# Some key ideas about probability

- When considering mutually exclusive events _A_ and _B_ (think sides of a die), the probability of _A_ or _B_ occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities - _P_(_A_ or _B_) = _P(A)_ + _P(B)_.

- _P(A|B)_ = _P(A,B)/P(B)_: A conditional probability is the probability that both _A_ and _B_ occur, divided by the probability that _B_ occurs. Another way to think about this is as the fraction of _B_ events that also include _A_. Yet another way to think about this is to ask, what have we learned about the probability of _A_, given that we know _B_ occurred?

- If _A_ and _B_ are independent, _P(A,B)_ = _P(A)P(B)_. The probability that two events occur is the product of their individual probabilities. Similarly, _P(A|B)_ = _P(A)_. If they're independent, we don't learn anything about the probability of _A_ given that we know _B_ occurred.
